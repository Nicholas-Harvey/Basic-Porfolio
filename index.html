            Hi, my name is Nick, nice to meet you and thanks for looking at my webpage. While I totally can empathize with you if you think that this site doesnt look all that great bu have faith in me, im trying my best.
            <br>
            So if you are interesed in my background I'd be happy to divulge. I was born in New york on Long Island and lived there from age 0-19 then I attended college in upstate New York, only returning to Long Island for breaks.
            <br>
            Following college I moved home to my moms house but soon after that I was able to rent my own appartment with a friend of mine from middle school. During this time I worked at Stony Brook University as the catering operations manager.
            <br>
            After one year and two months I moved to Denver, Colorado to work at the University of Denver as a Catering Supervispr. This was an unforseen demotion in my career so I began attending the University of Denver Coding Bootcamp in order for a career change which is how you have ended up reading this bio!
